# eeg_svm_thesis
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a project focusing on classifying Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The project aims to differentiate between "normal" and "abnormal" brain conditions, with data collected from the PhysioNet database. 

Various brain disorders such as insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, bruxism, and REM behavior disorder were tested to evaluate the classification accuracy. 

The repository includes documentation on the impact of data ratio scaling on classification accuracy and factors affecting fluctuations in accuracy, such as dataset characteristics and preprocessing processes.
